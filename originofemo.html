        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. In low spirits</span></p>
        <p>One of the most obvious signs of EMO is a significant depression. When we are EMO, the first thing we show is depression. When we are in EMO, our sensitivity to emotions is heightened, and small emotions can be amplified to further worsen our mood.</p>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. Loss of interest</span></p>
        <p>Emo can also lead to loss of interest, and depression can change our mood, making us pessimistic and negative. When we are in such a negative state of mind, we find it difficult to get results from anything we do, so we simply do nothing, which shows a loss of interest.</p>

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. Hard to sleep</span></p>
        <p>Emo can also make it difficult for us to fall asleep, tossing and turning in bed. When we're in emO, we think about a lot of things, a lot of things from the past, and draw negative conclusions from them. This can lead to anxiety, which can interfere with sleep.</p>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. Feel very tired</span></p>
        <p>When we are in the EMO state, we often feel tired. When we are in a bad mood, we lose energy and feel tired. This is so common in reality that we can clearly feel that when we are happy, we are doing everything with energy, as if we are not aware of exhaustion. But if we're in a bad mood, it's likely that little things will make us feel exhausted.</p>
