    <h1 style="text-align: justify;">Self-Regulation Techniques</h1>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">1. Mindful Breathing:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Practicing <strong><a href="https://www.calmsage.com/mindfulness-breathing-exercises/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Mindful breathing techniques</a></strong> every day in life keeps you grounded and present in the moment. It also beats stress, anxiety and anger which ultimately helps with self-regulation for adults. Not just breathing, <strong><a href="https://www.calmsage.com/type-of-meditation-technique/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">meditation</a> </strong>also helps in providing self-control that guides your actions in tough times.</p>

    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">2. Reframe Negative Thoughts:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone goes through negative thoughts but those who understand self-regulation well make sure that there is a solution to every negativity. It is recommended that you also take a step back as soon as <strong><a href="https://www.calmsage.com/how-to-deal-with-your-negative-thoughts/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">negative thought</a> </strong>strikes your mind and reframe the thoughts for positive solutions.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">3. Self-Affirmations:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><a href="https://www.calmsage.com/positive-self-affirmations/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Affirmations</a> </strong>like ‘I am getting better every day’ or ‘I can do this’ pushes you to perform at your best, even when you don’t want to do it.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">4. Visualisation Technique:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When you are lost from your path or wandering about what shall be done next, <strong><a href="https://www.calmsage.com/creative-visualization-techniques/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">visualization techniques</a> </strong>like vision board or rehearsals could be really helpful to regulate yourself.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">5. Body Awareness &amp; Sensations:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to include exercises in your schedule to clear out everyday stress. With that, you must keep in check how your body is reacting to different situations and sensations. It could be done with mindfulness only, so better keep yourself going with mind attentiveness.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">6. Form Bedtime Routine:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Add a special activity before sleeping to get on with a self-regulation strategy. It could be reading 2-5 pages of a book, thanking God for the day, or brushing your teeth. Simple!</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">7. Compliment Someone:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Complimenting someone every day makes you emotionally stronger and improves your relationship with people around you. A simple compliment like <strong>‘You are looking great today’</strong> or ‘It was a good speech that you just gave in the meeting room’ are good ways to start.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">8. Gratitude List:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">All the things that you love could be listed in your journal as it keeps reminding you of goodness.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Power of Gratitude" width="580" height="326" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fg0e67TLpc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">9. Express Yourself:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Through the means of new skills like dance, paint, design, sing or read, you can <strong><a href="https://www.calmsage.com/alexithymia-inability-to-express-emotions/">express your emotions</a></strong> in a better way. Any activity that you love aligns your <strong><a href="https://www.calmsage.com/how-to-balance-mind-body-and-soul-during-a-crisis/"  rel="noopener noreferrer">mind and body</a> </strong>for better coordination.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: justify;">10. Reinforcement:</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It often refers to rewarding yourself with something exciting if you achieve the goal. <strong>For example,</strong> you had a hectic and productive day, but it’s time to treat yourself with your favorite chocolate that you had already promised earlier.</p>
